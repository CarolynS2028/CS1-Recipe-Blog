</ol>

<h3>Ingredients (Buttercream)</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Unsalted Butter</li>
  <li>Heavy Cream</li>
  <li>Vanilla Bean Paste</li> 
  <li>Fine Sea Salt</li> 
  <li>Confectioner's Sugar</li>
</ul>

<h3>Steps</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Beat the butter for 2-3 minutes until it's light and fluffy. Make sure to scrape down the side of the mixure bowl as needed so all of the butter is evenly creamed.</li>
  <li><strong>Slowly</strong> add the Confectioner's Sugar to the butter, 1/2 cups at a time. Allow the sugar to incorporate with the butter. Leaving the mixer on medium-low speed so the confectioner's sugar doesn't explode everywhere is reccomened.</li>
  <li> Next, thin out the buttercream with some heavy cream, as well as add in flavoring with vanilla bean paste and fine sea salt.</li> 
  <li>Beat the buttercream on medium-high speed for a full 5 minutes. This will give the buttercream a light and fluffy texture.</li>
  <li>In order to smoothly pipe the buttercream, it's important to deflate it using a silicone spatula. Press the buttercream around the side of the mixer bowl until most of the air bubbles have been pushed out.</li>
<li>Finally, pipe the buttercream on one side of the macaron shell using your favorite piping tip!</li>
</ol>
