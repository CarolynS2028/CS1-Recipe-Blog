</ol>

<h3>Ingredients (Buttercream)</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Unsalted Butter</li>
  <li>Heavy Cream</li>
  <li>Vanilla Bean Paste</li> 
  <li>Fine Sea Salt</li> 
  <li>Confectioner's Sugar</li>
</ul>

<h3>Steps</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Beat the butter for 2-3 minutes until it's light and fluffy. Make sure to scrape down the side of the mixure bowl as needed so all of the butter is evenly creamed.</li>
  <li><strong>Slowly</strong> add the Confectioner's Sugar to the butter, 1/2 cups at a time. Allow the sugar to incorporate with the butter. Leaving the mixer on medium-low speed so the confectioner's sugar doesn't explode everywhere is reccomened.</li>
  <li> Next, thin out the buttercream with some heavy cream, as well as add in flavoring with vanilla bean paste and fine sea salt.</li> 
  <li>Beat the buttercream on medium-high speed for a full 5 minutes. This will give the buttercream a light and fluffy texture.</li>
  <li>In order to smoothly pipe the buttercream, it's important to deflate it using a silicone spatula. Press the buttercream around the side of the mixer bowl until most of the air bubbles have been pushed out.</li>
<li>Finally, pipe the buttercream on one side of the macaron shell using your favorite piping tip!</li>

<h2>Ice Cream Parfait</h2> 
<img src="ice cream parfait.jpg" width="40%">
<h3>Description</h3>
<p>Ice cream parfaits are a great, cool treat to have over the summer.</p>

<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>

<li>1½ cups heavy cream</li>
<li>⅔ cup cane sugar</li>
<li>2 teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
<li>⅛ teaspoon sea salt</li>

</ul>

<h3>Steps</h3>
<ol>
<li>In a medium saucepan, combine the cream, milk, sugar, vanilla, and salt. Warm over medium-low heat, whisking often, for 5 minutes, or until the sugar dissolves and the mixture is warmed through.</li>
<li>Pour into a heatproof bowl, cover, and chill for 2 hours or overnight.</li>
<li>Remove the chilled ice cream base from the fridge and whisk well. Churn in an ice cream maker according to the manufacturer’s instructions, typically 20 to 30 minutes. The ice cream will be soft after churning. For firmer ice cream, transfer to an airtight container and freeze for 2 to 4 hours before serving.</li>
<li>Store in an airtight container in the freezer for up to a month. If the ice cream is too firm to scoop straight from the freezer, let sit at room temperature for a few minutes to soften.</li>
<li>Decorate to your heart's content with toppings.</li>
